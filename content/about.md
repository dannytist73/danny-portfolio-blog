# Hello, I'm Danny üëã

I'm a Software Engineer at Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center, where I've been turning complex challenges into efficient solutions. My journey in software development has been quite unique - I've been a one-person development team, handling everything from requirements gathering to production deployment.

## My Journey

What makes my journey different is how I got here. I started as a Job Order developer without any mentors, learning everything on the job. It wasn't always smooth sailing - I had to rebuild some systems from scratch as I learned better ways to do things. But that's what makes this journey exciting - every challenge is an opportunity to grow.

### Key Projects That Shaped Me

#### PETRIS (Professional Education Training and Research Information System)

This is my largest project to date - a comprehensive system that digitalized our Training and Research department's manual processes. By the time I developed this, I had grown significantly as a developer. The system includes:

- A Learning Management System
- Competency Assessment Tools
- Digital Forms that streamlined workflows

#### BGHMC Outpatient Department eKiosk

This project taught me one of my biggest lessons in software development. Initially, I designed it to use biometric fingerprints for patient identification. After successfully integrating the biometric device (a challenge I had to learn from scratch!), I discovered that the device storage couldn't handle tens of thousands of fingerprints. This led to a pivot - switching to ID numbers instead. It was a valuable lesson in scalability and adaptability.

## What Drives Me

What makes me proud isn't just the technical challenges I've overcome, but the real impact my work has on people's lives. Seeing how my systems help both patients and hospital employees drives me to keep improving. This impact has been recognized too - I've been awarded as an exemplary employee twice, which motivates me to push even further.

## Technical Expertise

I work primarily with:

- Vue.js
- Laravel
- PHP

What's interesting about my tech stack is that I didn't know any of these when I started. I chose them because they were the frameworks used at the hospital, and I've grown to appreciate how they help me create systems that truly add value and improve processes.

## Beyond Coding

When I'm not coding, you'll find me:

- Creating digital art - this actually influences my development work, helping me design more engaging and artistic user interfaces while keeping them professional
- Riding my motorcycle and exploring new places
- Lifting weights at the gym
