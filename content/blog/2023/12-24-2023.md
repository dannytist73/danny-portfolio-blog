# Kaizen: A Fitness Journey

![Cover Image - Person doing workout or transformation photo](/images/blog-posts/2023/kaizen.jpg)

2023 was the year I got into fitness. I started at 88kg, which was in the obese category for my height, struggling with low self-esteem and almost giving up on fitness. Then came a pivotal moment that changed everything. With the pandemic having added those extra pounds to many of us, it was high time I took control back of my health and embraced a healthier lifestyle.

## The Shift in Focus

I learned in life that what you water daily will bloom and grow. That applies to what we focus on as well. If I learn a programming language and focus on it, use it to create projects, I would definitely gain confidence in it and my skills will grow.

The same applies to fitness. The turning point in my journey came when I decided to invest in myself by joining the Kaizen Fitness program by Coach Cho Lim. The decision to make a significant financial investment became my anchor of commitment – I wasn't going to let that investment go to waste.

## The Journey Begins

My journey started with three fundamental pillars:

1. Walking 10,000 steps daily
2. Working out three times per week
3. Tracking every calorie and gram of protein

The results? By November 2023, I had lost 20kg, reaching 68kg from my initial 88kg.

## Nutrition: The Game Changer

The most crucial aspect of my transformation was nutrition. I meticulously weighed my food and prioritized protein intake. Starting with a 500-calorie deficit, I progressively reduced my intake by 100 calories each week. During the most intensive phase of my weight loss journey, I maintained a strict diet of 1000 calories while ensuring I got 140g of protein daily.

## Overcoming Challenges

Like any transformation journey, mine wasn't without obstacles. There were days when hunger got the better of me, leading to broken rules. Sometimes, work pressures would tempt me back into the "I'll start tomorrow" mindset. But what made this attempt different was the support system:

- Accountability groups through the Kaizen program
- Competition tracking via Google Sheets
- The Hevy app for logging workouts
- Regular progress monitoring

## Beyond Physical Transformation

The benefits extended far beyond the physical changes. I experienced:

- Increased self-confidence
- Better social skills
- Improved mental health
- The ability to inspire others
- A healthier relationship with myself

## The Brogrammer Life

As a software developer, this journey has profoundly impacted my professional life. I've become what I jokingly call a "Brogrammer" – someone who's both jacked and intelligent! The confidence boost has been incredible, making me feel like I can take on any challenge.

Most importantly, this journey taught me two crucial lessons that apply both in the gym and in coding:

1. If you put your mind to something, you can achieve spectacular results
2. The smallest daily changes compound into the biggest game-changers

## Advice for Those Starting Out

For anyone reading this who's where I was at 88kg, here's my advice:

- Go all in on your fitness journey
- Take progress photos (even if you never share them)
- Find accountability partners
- Start small but focus on progressive overload
- Remember: just like in programming, you can debug and improve your approach daily

## Tools and Resources I Used

- Kaizen Fitness Program by Coach Cho Lim
- Google Sheets for tracking
- Hevy app for workout logging
- Accountability groups

## Conclusion

This journey has been about more than just losing weight – it's been about proving to myself that with the right mindset, support system, and dedication, any goal is achievable. Whether it's fitness goals or coding challenges, the principle remains the same: consistent small improvements lead to remarkable transformations.

Remember, you don't have to be perfect; you just need to be better than yesterday. That's the true essence of Kaizen.
